# Image Classification with CNN on CIFAR-10 Dataset

## Project Description
This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, such as airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, dogs, and more. The project includes the following steps:

- Loading the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Preprocessing the images (normalization and conversion to tensors).
- Defining a CNN model architecture.
- Training the model on the training set.
- Evaluating the model accuracy on the test set.
- Visualizing some test images and model predictions.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following libraries:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- numpy

You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy
