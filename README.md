# Image-Classification-with-CNN-on-CIFAR-10-Dataset
This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.
